# Water Vapor Vertical Profile Retrieval from Spectral Data

## Overview
This project addresses the optimization of a computationally expensive matrix calculation used to estimate vertical water vapor profiles from spectral measurements, with the ultimate goal of applying it to a 22 GHz radiometer.  
The proposed approach leverages **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** regression models to replace the traditional numerical computation with a faster, data-driven alternative.

## Problem Statement
Traditional methods for retrieving vertical water vapor profiles from spectral data involve high-cost matrix operations that can become a bottleneck in real-time applications. This is particularly relevant for radiometric systems operating at 22 GHz, where efficient computation is essential.

## Approach
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Spectral measurements (input features).  
   - Corresponding vertical water vapor profiles (target variables).  
   - Data preprocessing and normalization.  

2. **Modeling**  
   Several ML/DL regression algorithms were evaluated, including:  
   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  
   - **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**  
   - **Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)**  
   - **Decision Tree Regressor**  
   - **Ridge Regression**  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Models were compared based on prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.  
   - Performance metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and inference time.  

## Results
Among all tested models, the **Decision Tree Regressor** achieved the best balance between accuracy and computational cost, outperforming deep learning alternatives in both speed and prediction quality for the given dataset.

## Future Work
- Explore **ensemble methods** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for potential accuracy improvements.  
- Integrate the trained model into the real-time processing pipeline of the 22 GHz radiometer.  
- Extend the approach to other frequency bands for broader applicability.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+  
- NumPy  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning experiments)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
